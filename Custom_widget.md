## To-do List
```
The "To-do List Widget" was built to provide a simple interface for users to create and manage their to-do lists.
The widget provides a straightforward way for users to input their tasks, set the desired time and period, and manage their to-do list by adding or deleting tasks.
 Users can view their tasks in a clean list format and easily keep track of their upcoming tasks.
I choose to create the To-do list because it is related to all widget provided  as they are all used for  planning purpose.

Here's how the widget works:

At first, it displays a heading "To-do List" along with input fields for entering a task, time, and period, and a button to add a task.
The user can enter the task description in the input field provided(Enter a task field).
The user can enter the desired time for the task in the input field provided(Enter time field).
The user can select the period (AM/PM) for the task from the dropdown menu(Select period field).

When the user clicks the "Add Task" button, the addTask function is triggered. It checks if the task, time, and period values are not empty. If all values are provided, a new task object containing the task, time, and period is created.
The added tasks are rendered as list items within an unordered list.
Each list item displays the task description along with its associated time and period in parentheses.
The "Done" button is used to remove a task from the list after completion.
